### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [API.AI](https://api.ai).

I've got a [Google Home](https://madeby.google.com/home/) (US version) to play with for a few weeks. It works well in Australia although sometimes it gives me the temperature in Fahrenheit rather than Celcius. We could create a custom Google Home integration using [API.AI](https://api.ai). This project will be code-free and it is a way for me to learn more about API.AI.

### Implementation

Google bought API.AI in September 2016 and it requires you to use this platform to create actions for Google Home. Make sure that the API.AI account is the same as the Google account used by the Google Home device. Otherwise, we won't be able to test our actions on the actual hardware.

Login to API.AI and create a new agent as shown below:

We add some sample data, in this case Easter Egg data, that allows us to test some predefined intents:
