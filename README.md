### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [API.AI](https://api.ai).

I've got a [Google Home](https://madeby.google.com/home/) (US version) to play with for a few weeks. It works well in Australia although sometimes it gives me the temperature in Fahrenheit rather than Celcius. We could create a custom Google Home integration using [API.AI](https://api.ai). This project will be code-free and it is a way for me to learn more about API.AI.
